Type System (I): TorchScript Types
==================================

This section summarizes TorchScript type system. The information is based on TorchScript language reference
and reading the implementation.

Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^

This document uses the following terminologies:

::

    " " represents real keywords and delimiters that are part of the syntax
    A | B indicates either A or B
    ( ) indicates grouping
    [ ] indicates optional
    A+ indicates a regular expression where term A is repeated at least once
    A* indicates a regular expression where term A is repeated zero or more times

TorchScript Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TorchScript type system consists of ``TSType`` and ``TSModuleType`` as defined below.

::

    TSAllType := TSType | TSModuleType
    TSType := TSMetaType | TSPrimitiveType | TSStructuralType | TSNominalType

``TSType`` represents the majority of TorchScript types, that are composable and can be used in TorchScript type annotation.
``TSType`` can be further classified into:

* meta types, e.g., Any
* primitive types, e.g., int, float, str
* structural types, e.g., Optional[int] or List[MyClass]
* nominal types (Python classes), e.g., MyClass (user-defined), torch.tensor (builtin)

``TSModuleType`` represents torch.nn.Module and its subclasses. It is treated differently from ``TSType`` because its type schema is inferred partly from the object instance and partly from the class definition.
As such, instances of a ``TSModuleType`` may not follow the same static type schema. ``TSModuleType`` cannot be used in TorchScript type annotation or be composed with TSType for type safety considerations.

Meta Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Meta types are so abstract that they are more like type constraints than concrete types.
Currently TorchScript defines one meta-type, ``Any``, that represents any TorchScript type.

Any Type
""""""""

The ``Any`` type literally represents any type. ``Any`` specifies no type constraints, thus there is no type checking on ``Any``.
As such it can be bound to any Python or TorchScript data types (e.g., int, TorchScript tuple, or an arbitrary Python class that is not scripted).

::

    TSMetaType := "Any"

where

    * ``Any`` is the Python class name from the typing module, therefore usage of the ``Any`` type requires from typing import Any
    * Since Any can represent any data, operators allowed on Any is quite limited

Operators supported for Any type
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* assignment to data of Any type
* binding to parameter or return of Any type
* x is, x is not  where x is of Any type
* isinstance(x, Type) where x is of Any type
* data of Any type is printable
* Data of List[Any] type may be sortable if the data is a list of values of the same type T and that T supports comparison operators

Compared to Python
""""""""""""""""""

``Any`` is the least constrained type in the TorchScript type system. In that sense, it is quite similar to
Object class in Python. However, ``Any`` only supports a subset of the operators and methods that are supported by Object.

Design notes
""""""""""""

When we script a PyTorch module, we may encounter data that are not involved in the execution of the script, nevertheless has to be described
by a type schema. It is not only cumbersome to describe static types for unused data (in the context of the script) but also may lead to unnecessary
scripting failures. Any is introduced to describe the type of the data where precise static types are not necessary for compilation.

Example:

This example illustrates how ``Any`` can be used to allow the second element of the tuple parameter to be of any type. This is possible,
because ``x[1]`` is not involved in any computation that requires knowing its precise type.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    from typing import Tuple
    from typing import Any

    @torch.jit.export
    def incFirstElement(x: Tuple[int, Any]):
    return (x[0]+1, x[1])

    m = torch.jit.script(incFirstElement)
    print(incFirstElement((1,2.0)))
    print(incFirstElement((1,(100,200))))

The example will generate the following output, where the second element of the tuple is of ``Any`` type
thus can bind to multiple types, e.g., (1, 2.0) binds a float type to Any as in ``Tuple[int, Any]``,
whereas ``(1, (100, 200))`` binds a tuple to ``Any`` in the second invocation.

.. testoutput::

    (2, 2.0)
    (2, (100, 200))

Example:

We can use isinstance to dynamically check the type of the data annotated as ``Any`` type.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import Any

    def f(a:Any):
        print(a)
        return (isinstance(a, torch.Tensor))

    ones = torch.ones([2])
    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print(m(ones))

The above example produces the following output

.. testoutput::

    1
    1
    [ CPUFloatType{2} ]
    True

Primitive Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Primitive TorchScript types represent types that represent a single type of value and go with a single pre-defined
type name.

::

    TSPrimitiveType := "int" | "float" | "double" | "complex" | "bool" | "str" | "None"

Structural Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Structural types are types that are structurally defined without a user-defined name (unlike nominal types),
such as ``Future[int]``. Structural types are composable with any ``TSType``.

::

    TSStructualType :=  TSTuple | TSNamedTuple | TSList | TSDict |
                        TSOptional | TSFuture | TSRRef

    TSTuple := "Tuple" "[" (TSType ",")* TSType "]"
    TSNamedTuple := "namedtuple" "(" (TSType ",")* TSType ")"
    TSList := "List" "[" TSType "]"
    TSOptional := "Optional" "[" TSType "]"
    TSFuture := "Future" "[" TSType "]"
    TSRRef := "RRef" "[" TSType "]"
    TSDict := "Dict" "[" KeyType "," TSType "]"
    KeyType := "str" | "int" | "float" | "bool" | TensorType | "Any"

where

* ``Tuple``, ``List``, ``Optional``, ``Union``, ``Future``, ``Dict`` represent Python type class names defined in module typing. Therefore before using these type names, one must import them from ``typing (e.g., from typing import Tuple)``.
* namedtuple represents Python class  ``collections.namedtuple`` or ``typing.NamedTuple`` .
* ``Future`` and ``RRef`` represent Python classes  ``torch.futures``, ``torch.distributed.rpc``.

Compared to Python
""""""""""""""""""

* Apart from only composable with TorchScript types, these TorchScript structural types often support a common subset of
the operators and methods of its Python counterparts.

Example:

This example uses typing.NamedTuple syntax:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import NamedTuple
    from typing import Tuple

    class MyTuple(NamedTuple):
        first: int
        second: int

    def inc(x: MyTuple) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return (x.first+1, x.second+1)

    t = MyTuple(first=1, second=2)
    scripted_inc = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print("TorchScript:", scripted_inc(t))

This example uses ``collections.namedtuple`` syntax:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import NamedTuple
    from typing import Tuple
    from collections import namedtuple

    _AnnotatedNamedTuple = NamedTuple('_NamedTupleAnnotated', [('first', int), ('second', int)])
    _UnannotatedNamedTuple = namedtuple('_NamedTupleAnnotated', ['first', 'second'])

    def inc(x: _AnnotatedNamedTuple) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return (x.first+1, x.second+1)

    m = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print(inc(_UnannotatedNamedTuple(1,2)))

Example:

This example illustrates a common mistake of annotating structural types, i.e., not importing the composite type
classes from the ``typing`` module.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    # ERROR: Tuple not recognized because not imported from typing
    @torch.jit.export
    def inc(x: Tuple[int, int]):
    return (x[0]+1, x[1]+1)

    m = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print(inc((1,2)))

Running the above codes yields the following scripting error. The remedy is to add from ``typing import Tuple``.

.. testoutput::

    File "test-tuple.py", line 5, in <module>
        def inc(x: Tuple[int, int]):
    NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined

Nominal Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nominal TorchScript types are Python classes. They are called nominal because these types are declared with a custom
name and are compared using class names. Nominal classes are further classified into the following categories:

::

    TSNominalType := TSBuiltinClasses | TSCustomClass | TSEnum

Among them, ``TSCustomClass`` and ``TSEnum`` must be compilable to TorchScript IR (as enforced by the type-checker).

Builtin Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Builtin nominal types are Python classes whose semantics are built into the TorchScript system, such as tensor types.
TorchScript defines the semantics of these builtin nominal types, and often support only a subset of the methods or
attributes of its Python class definition.

::

    TSBuiltinClass := TSTensor | "torch.device" | "torch.Stream" | "torch.dtype" |
                    "torch.nn.ModuleList" | "torch.nn.ModuleDict" | ...
    TSTensor := "torch.Tensor" | "common.SubTensor" | "common.SubWithTorchFunction" |
                "torch.nn.parameter.Parameter" | and subclasses of torch.Tensor


Special note on torch.nn.ModuleList and torch.nn.ModuleDict
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Although torch.nn.ModuleList and torch.nn.ModuleDict are defined as a list and dictionary in Python,
in TorchScript, ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` and ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` behave more like a tuple.

* Within the execution of TorchScript, instances of ``torch.nn.ModuleList``  or ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` are immutable.
* Iterating over ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` or ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` is completely unrolled so that elements of ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` or keys of ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` can be of different subclasses of ``torch.nn.Module``.

Example:

.. testcode::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    class A():
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = torch.rand(3)

        def f(self, y: torch.device):
            return self.x.to(device=y)

    def g():
        a = A()
        return a.f(torch.device("cpu"))

    script_g = torch.jit.script(g)
    print(script_g.graph)

Custom Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike built-in classes, semantics of custom classes are user-defined and the entire class definition must be compilable into TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript type-checking rules.

::

    TSClassDef := [ "@torch.jit.script" ]
                "class" ClassName [ "(object)" ]  ":"
                        MethodDefinition

where

* Classes must be new-style classes (note that Python 3 supports only new-style classes, for Python 2.x new-style class is specified by subclassing from object)
* Instance data attributes are statically typed, and instance attributes must be declared by assignments inside the ``__init__()`` method
* Method overloading is not supported (i.e., cannot have multiple methods with the same method name)
* MethodDefinition must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript’s type-checking rules, i.e., all methods must be valid TorchScript functions and class attribute definitions are valid TorchScript statements


Compared to Python
""""""""""""""""""

TorchScript custom class is quite limited compared to its Python counterpart. Most notably, TorchScript custom classes

* do not support class attributes
* do not support subclassing except for subclassing an interface type or object
* do not support method overloading
* must initialize all its instance attributes in  ``__init__()``; this is because TorchScript construct a static schema of the class by inferring attribute types in ``__init__()``
* must contain only methods that satisfy TorchScript type-checking rules and are compilable to TorchScript IRs

Example:

Python classes can be used in TorchScript if they are annotated with ``@torch.jit.script``, similar to how you would declare a TorchScript function:

.. testcode::

    @torch.jit.script
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            self.x = x

        def inc(self, val: int):
            self.x += val


Example:

A TorchScript custom class type must "declare" all its instance attributes by assignments in ``__init__()``. If an instance attribute is not defined in ``__init__()`` but accessed in other methods of the class, the class cannot be compiled as a TorchScript class, as shown in the following example:

.. testcode::

    @torch.jit.script
    class foo:
        def __init__(self):
            self.y = 1

        # ERROR: self.x is not defined in __init__
        def assign_x(self):
            self.x = torch.rand(2, 3)

 The above class will fail to be compiled and issue the following error:

.. testoutput::

    RuntimeError:
    Tried to set nonexistent attribute: x. Did you forget to initialize it in __init__()?:
    def assign_x(self):
        self.x = torch.rand(2, 3)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <--- HERE

Example:

In this example, a TorchScript custom class defines a class variable name, which is not allowed.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    class MyClass(object):
        name = "MyClass"
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            self.x = x

    def fn(a: MyClass):
        return a.name

It leads to the following compile-time error:

.. testoutput::

    RuntimeError:
    Tried to access nonexistent attribute or method 'name' of type '__torch__.MyClass'. Did you forget to initialize an attribute in __init__()?:
        File "test-class2.py", line 10
    def fn(a: MyClass):
        return a.name
            ~~~~~~ <--- HERE

Enum Type
^^^^^^^^^^

Like custom classes, semantics of enum type are user-defined and the entire class definition must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript type-checking rules.

::

    TSEnumDef := "class" Identifier "(enum.Enum | TSEnumType)" ":"
                ( MemberIdentifier "=" Value )+
                ( MethodDefinition )*

where

* Value must be TorchScript literals of type ``int``, ``float``, or ``str``, and must be of the same TorchScript type
* ``TSEnumType`` is the name of a TorchScript ``enum`` type. Similar to Python enum, TorchScript allows restricted Enum subclassing, that is, subclassing an enum is allowed only if the enum does not define any members.

Compared to Python
""""""""""""""""""

* TorchScript supports only ``enum.Enum``, but not other variations such as ``enum.IntEnum``, ``enum.Flag``, ``enum.IntFlag``, or  ``enum.auto``
* Values of TorchScript enum members must be of the same type and can only be of ``int``, ``float``, or ``str`` type, whereas Python enum members can be of any type
* Enums containing methods, are ignored in TorchScript.

Example:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from enum import Enum

    class Color(Enum):
        RED = 1
        GREEN = 2

    def enum_fn(x: Color, y: Color) -> bool:
        if x == Color.RED:
            return True
        return x == y

    m = torch.jit.script(enum_fn)

    print("Eager: ", enum_fn(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))
    print("TorchScript: ", m(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))

Example:

The following example shows the case of restricted enum subclassing, where BaseColor does not define any member, thus can be subclassed by Color.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from enum import Enum

    class BaseColor(Enum):
        def foo(self):
            pass

    class Color(BaseColor):
        RED = 1
        GREEN = 2

    def enum_fn(x: Color, y: Color) -> bool:
        if x == Color.RED:
            return True

        return x == y

    m = torch.jit.script(enum_fn)
    print("TorchScript: ", m(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))
    print("Eager: ", enum_fn(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))

TorchScript Module Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``TSModuleType`` is a special class type that is inferred from object instances created outside TorchScript. Although ``TSModuleType`` is named by the Python class of the object instance. Method ``__init__()`` of the Python class are not considered as a TorchScript method, thus it does not have to comply to TorchScript’s type checking rules.

Since the type schema of module instance class is constructed directly from an instance object (created outside the scope of TorchScript), rather than inferred from ``__init__()`` like custom classes. It is possible that two objects of the same instance class type follow two different type schemas.

In this sense, ``TSModuleType`` is not really a static type. Therefore, for type safety considerations, ``TSModuleType`` cannot be used in TorchScript type annotation or be composed with ``TSType``.

Module Instance Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript module type represents type schema of a user-defined PyTorch module instance.  When scripting a PyTorch module, the module object is always created outside TorchScript (i.e., passed in as parameter to forward()), the Python module class is treated as a module instance class so that ``__init__()`` of the Python module class are not subject to the type checking rules of TorchScript

::

    TSModuleType := "class" Identifier "(torch.nn.Module)" ":"
                        ClassBodyDefinition

where

* ``forward()`` and other methods decorated with ``@torch.jit.export`` must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript’s type checking rules

Unlike custom classes, only the forward method and other methods decorated with ``@torch.jit.export``  of the module type need to be compilable to TorchScript IR. Most notably, ``__init__()`` is not considered a TorchScript method. Thus module type constructors should not be invoked within the scope of TorchScript. Instead, TorchScript module objects are always constructed outside and passed into ``torch.jit.script(ModuleObj)``.

Example:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    class TestModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, v):
            super().__init__()
            self.x = v

        def mul(self, x: int):
            return self.x * x

        @torch.jit.export
        def madd(self, x: int, y: int):
            return self.mul(x) + y

        def forward(self, x: int):
            return self.x + x

    m = torch.jit.script(TestModule(2))
    print(m.madd(2, 3))

    m = torch.jit.script(TestModule(2.0))
    print(m.madd(2, 3))

.. testoutput::

    7
    7.0

This example illustrates a few features of module types:

*  The TestModule instance is created outside the scope of TorchScript (i.e., before invoking torch.jit.script).
* ``__init__()`` is not considered as a TorchScript method, therefore it does not have to be annotated and can contain arbitrary Python codes. In fact, it is prohibited to invoke ``__init__()`` of a instance class within the scope of TorchScript execution.
* Because TestModule instances are instantiated in Python, in this example, TestModule(2.0) and TestModule(2) create two instances with different types for its data attributes, i.e., (self.x is of type float for TestModule(2.0), whereas self.y is of type int for TestModule(2.0)).
  In this sense, module instance type provides a mechanism to specialize a class definition to different types based on how the instance is instantiated.
* TorchScript automatically compiles other methods (e.g., mul()) invoked by methods annotated via ``@torch.jit.export`` or ``forward()`` methods
* Entry-points to a TorchScript program are either ``forward()`` of a module type or methods annotated via ``torch.jit.script``

Example:

The following shows an incorrect usage of module type. Specifically, this example invokes the constructor of TestModule inside the scope of TorchScript.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    class TestModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, v):
            super().__init__()
            self.x = v

        def forward(self, x: int):
            return self.x + x

    class MyModel:
        def __init__(self, v: int):
            self.val = v

        @torch.jit.export
        def doSomething(self, val: int) -> int:
            # error: should not invoke the constructor of module type
            myModel = TestModule(self.val)
            return myModel(val)

    m = torch.jit.script(MyModel(2))
    print(m.doSomething(3))

.. testoutput::

    RuntimeError: Could not get name of python class object
